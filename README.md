# mdxcn

React components for ASCII-style tables, charts, and diagrams in MDX. Built so an agent can drop a figure next to prose — JSX in MDX, `::graph-*` in Comark, `graph_*` in Knap, official ASCII in a README. Each graph sits in a dashed frame with a title on the top edge. One accent color by default; drawing graphs can take `palette="duo"` or `palette="multi"`. You copy the source into your project — this is not an npm package.

## Install

You need an existing [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com) project and [`motion`](https://motion.dev).

Add the `@mdxcn` registry once, then install by name:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest registry add @mdxcn=https://mdxcn.dev/r/{name}.json
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @mdxcn/graph-table
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @mdxcn/all
```

Or paste the full URL once:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://mdxcn.dev/r/graph-table.json
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://mdxcn.dev/r/all.json
```

`components.json` after `registry add`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@mdxcn": "https://mdxcn.dev/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

Files land under `@/registry/default`. Import from there:

```tsx
import { GraphTable } from "@/registry/default/graph-table/graph-table"
```

Every component reads the same Markdown inside its tag — bold is now, italic is next, `label: value` is a row, `— note` is a side note, `ok*40` is a run. The rules: [grammar](https://mdxcn.dev/docs/grammar). The same Markdown works as a Comark block body and a Knap `body`, and draws the same fenced ASCII.

```mdx
<GraphTimeline title="NIGHT">

- 14:02: p95 crossed 800ms — paged the on-call
- **14:11: rolled back the cache flag**
- *14:40: write the postmortem*

</GraphTimeline>
```

Wrap your MDX components in `withMdxcn` (registry item `mdx`). Tags your docs framework swaps — `li`, `table`, `h3` — still parse, and plain Markdown gets a frame: `> [!WARNING]` becomes a Callout, a `— Name` byline a Quote, a `console` fence a Terminal, footnotes a framed list. GitHub still renders the original. See [mdx](https://mdxcn.dev/docs/mdx).

Each docs page has CLI, manual, agent, MDX, Comark, and Knap install tabs. Copy page puts the markdown (install, prompt, examples, props) on the clipboard.

Comark apps render the same figures from `::graph-*` blocks in a plain `.md` file — no MDX. Copy `graph-comark` (already in `all.json`). Full install: `graphComponents` from `graph-comark.tsx`. Subset: `createGraphComponents`. Wiring: [Comark](https://mdxcn.dev/docs/comark). Pitch: [Comark landing](https://mdxcn.dev/comark).

Knap templates pipe the same props through `graph_*` filters and emit the official fence (or a `::graph-*` block). Copy `graph-knap` (already in `all.json`). Spread `graphFilters` into `createEngine`. The Knap CLI does not load them. Wiring: [Knap](https://mdxcn.dev/docs/knap). Pitch: [Knap landing](https://mdxcn.dev/knap).

Composed write-ups (refactor, incident, tradeoff, PR, sprint, migration) live on [Examples](https://mdxcn.dev/docs/examples). [for agents](https://mdxcn.dev/agents) is the write and read story. The [skill](https://mdxcn.dev/docs/skill) tells an agent which graph to put next to the prose — JSX in React, `::graph-*` in Comark, `graph_*` in Knap, fenced ASCII in GitHub. Agents can also fetch [`/llms.txt`](https://mdxcn.dev/llms.txt) for the chooser, the ASCII blocks, the Comark blocks, and the Knap filters.

## Design

- Geist Mono. Dashed frame, `+` corners (swap with `corner`), title as `[ TITLE ]`.
- One accent: `--graph-accent`. Unused rows recede with opacity. `palette="duo"` / `"multi"` opt into `--graph-accent-2` and `--graph-accent-3`.
- Glyphs do the drawing (`█ ▓ ▒ ░ · - = + | ├ └ ✓`). Tracks that represent a range (meter, stack, bullet, rank) span the frame. Spark, bars, cells, and uptime stay packed at 1ch. Pass `glyphs` (`shade` `ascii` `hash` `bar`, or your own characters). No SVG.
- Numbers use `tabular-nums`. Amounts sit right-aligned.
- Motion is transform and opacity only, 220ms, no loops. `prefers-reduced-motion` sets duration to 0.

## Development
