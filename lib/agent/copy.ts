  "When an agent is writing a refactor, an incident, a tradeoff, or a PR, it can put at most two graphs next to the prose. React files get JSX; a Comark app gets a ::graph-* block with YAML props; a Knap template gets a graph_* filter that emits the official fence; a README, GitHub comment, Linear note, or any plain Markdown that cannot run a renderer gets the official fenced ASCII from /llms.txt. It should not invent SVG, Mermaid, or homemade ASCII."

## Write

Install the skill into the folder the agent already reads. Ask for a write-up. The chooser picks the graph. Copy the props from the docs or a recipe, then swap the labels.
