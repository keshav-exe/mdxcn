Every component reads the same Markdown. Learn these rules once. They work as MDX children, as the body of a Comark block, as the \`body\` of a Knap content filter, and they draw the same fenced ASCII.

### Upgrades

Wrap your MDX components in \`withMdxcn\` (${host}/docs/mdx) and plain Markdown becomes a frame. GitHub still renders the original.

MDX:

${GRAMMAR_SAMPLE.mdx}

Comark (the body is the same list):
